    "* Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing with broad applications such as:\n",
    "  * Topic Labeling: Another common example of text classification is topic labeling that is, understanding what a given text is talking about. It’s often used for structuring and organizing data, such as organizing customer feedback by topic or organizing news articles by subject.\n",
    "  * Intent detection: Intent detection or intent classification is another great use case for text classifi cationthat analyzes text to understand the reason behind feedback. Maybe it’s a complaint, ormaybe a customer is expressing intent to purchase a product. It’s used for customerservice, marketing email responses, generating product analytics and automating business practices. Intent detection with machine learning can read emails and chatbotconversations and automatically route them to the correct department. Some of the email intent classifier tags are Interested, Not Interested, Unsubscribe, Wrong Person, Email Bounce\n",
    "and Autoresponder.\n",
    "  * Sentiment Analysis: The most popular example of text classification is\n",
    "sentiment analysis (or) opinion mining. The automated process of reading a text for opinion polarity (positive, negative, neutral and beyond). Companies use sentiment classifiers on a wide range ofapplications like product analytics, brand monitoring, market research, customer support, workforce analytics and much more. Sentiment analysis allows us to automatically analyze all forms of text for the feeling and emotion.\n",
    "  * Language Detection: Language detection is another great example of text classification that is, the process ofclassifying incoming text according to its language. These text classifiers are often used for routing purposes (e.g., route support tickets according to their language to the appropriate team).\n",
    "  * Spam Detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text classification can be done in two ways:\n",
    "  * Manual: Manual text classification involves a human annotator, who interprets the content of text and categorizes it accordingly. This method can deliver good results but it's time-consuming and expensive.\n",
    "  * Automatic: Automatic text classification applies Machine Learning,\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other AI-guided techniques\n",
    "to automatically classify text in a faster, more cost-eff ective and more accurate manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are many approaches to automatic text classification but they all fall under three types of systems:\n",
    "  * Machine Learning-based Systems\n",
    "  * Rule-based Systems\n",
    "  * Hybrid Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine Learning-based Systems: Machine learning text classification learns to make classifications based on past observations. By using pre-labeled examples as training data, machine learning algorithms can learn the different associations between pieces of text and that a particular output (i.e., tags) is expected for a particular input(i.e., text). A “tag” is the pre-determined classification or category that any given text could fall into.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For example, if we have defined our dictionary to have the following words {This, is, the, not, awesome, bad, basketball}, and we wanted to vectorize the text “This is awesome”, we would have the following vector representation of that text: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0). Then, the machine learning algorithm is fed with training data that consists of pairs offeature sets (vectors for each text example) and tags (e.g. sports, politics) to produce aclassification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text Classifi cation with Python: Python is usually the programming language of choice for developers and data scientist swho work with machine learning models. The simple syntax, its massive community and the scientific-computing friendliness of its mathematical libraries are some of the reasonswhy Python is so prevalent in the field.  Following are the popular Python libraries used in text classification:\n",
    "  * Scikit-learn\n",
    "  * NLTK\n",
    "  * SpaCy\n",
    "  * TensorFlow\n",
    "  * PyTorch\n",

    "* Link(s):<br>\n",
    "  https://monkeylearn.com/text-classification/\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-Class Classification: In multi-class classification, each input will have only one output class. For example, if we are building an animal classifier that classifies among Dog, Rabbit, Cat and Tiger, it makes sense only for one of these classes to be selected each time.\n",
    "* Multi-Label Classification: In multi-label classification, each input can have multi-output classes. For example, if we are building a model which predicts all the clothing articles a person is wearing, we can use a multi-label\n",
    "classification model since there can be more than one possible option at once i.e. a person can wear multiple clothing articles at a given point of time.\n",

    "With visa office closures and international travel restrictions still in place, experts say the economic benefits of President Donald Trump’s immigration suspension last week are uncertain, at best, while thousands of prospective immigrants still stand to suffer the consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the suspension was filled with broad exemptions and does not include current visa holders or those already in the U.S., the Migration Policy Institute estimates 26,000 would-be green card applicants would be blocked each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the weekend, a coalition of advocacy groups filed an emergency request to halt Trump’s directive. It was the latest move in a 2019 case, stemming from when the White House sought to ban immigrants who couldn’t prove their ability to acquire.\n",
    "Attorneys with the American Immigration Lawyers Association requested a hold on the recent suspension order while the courts continue to decide the fate of the health insurance restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The White House framed the immigration suspension as a vital component of helping the economy and American workers recover, but it could have the opposite effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immigrants already in the U.S. and those who already have certain visas can still obtain permanent residency. The suspension applies only to green card applicants from outside the country and primarily targets to those looking to settle down in the U.S. permanently through a family connection, according to MPI estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "That leaves the possibility of employment-based visa slots opening up as a result of the suspension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"President Trump claims he signed it in order to protect the economy in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, but the reality is that our economic recovery will depend on immigrants,\" said Esther Sung, a senior attorney involved in the 2019 case.\n",
    "\n",
    "That view is shared, in part, by Rutgers economics professor Jennifer Hunt. She told ABC News that an influx of workers into critical sectors of the economy could boost per capita GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It would be kind of a shot in the arm,\" Hunt said.\n",
    "\n",
    "On-going travel restrictions and the closure of foreign visa offices still pose the greatest barrier to legal immigration in the age of coronavirus.

    "Elon Musk told the world in late 2017 that Tesla was taking its automotive know-how and applying it to a totally new challenge: self-driving big rigs. But one year later, he placed the Tesla Semi fourth on a list of priorities for the company, behind the upcoming Model Y compact SUV and an electric pickup truck. This week, Daimler executed a move many years in the making by announcing its own big rig (albeit diesel-powered) outfitted with semi-autonomous technology. And others are following suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The German automaker also committed to manufacturing the truck this summer, with deliveries scheduled for later this year. It pledged 500 million euros over the next few years to the continued development of an autonomous big rig, and said it has hired hundreds of employees to move the tech forward. And just like it did when it unveiled the prototype version in 2015, Daimler gave us a ride in the truck to get a taste of what the near future of trucking will look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are a few Tesla Semi prototypes on the road now, and a dozen or so big name companies have placed preorders for the trucks, it doesn’t look like a production version is coming any time soon. Tesla still hasn’t said where or exactly when it will build the trucks, and would likely need to raise more money (or sell a hell of a lot more Model 3s) to fund the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAIMLER FIRST SHOWED OFF A PROTOTYPE IN 2015\n",
    "This has left the door wide open for companies like Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz. Daimler announced it was working on its own self-driving big rig in 2015 when it showed off a working prototype called the Freightliner Inspiration Truck. The automaker went big, debuting the truck on the Hoover Dam and offering test rides at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show, Daimler returned to Las Vegas to make good on its promise with a production version of that prototype truck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new Cascadia is not much more advanced than the prototype was in 2015. In fact, the technology is still pretty limited. Daimler says it’s the first Class 8 commercial truck with Level 2 autonomy (referring to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ scale for self-driving definitions), meaning the driver is in control, but is supported heavily by the truck’s technology in certain situations. In that sense, the new Cascadia essentially has the same basic driver assistance technology many modern cars offer, including automatic lane centering, adaptive cruise control, and emergency braking.\n",
    " \n",
    "The Freightliner Inspiration Truck at the event in 2015.\n",
    "But the new Cascadia is doing this with a limited set of sensors. There’s a forward-facing camera, a forward-facing radar, a second radar sensor on the right side of the truck. That package pales in comparison to the dozens of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radars you’d find powering Autopilot, let alone the Tesla Semi, which is supposed to have a beefed-up version of this same sensor suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps keep costs down, but means the technology is more in line with what you’d find powering something like Nissan’s ProPilot driver assistance feature as opposed to Autopilot, or even Audi’s supposedly Level 3 system, which uses similar tech, but relies on LIDAR as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAIMLER’S TRUCK HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH NISSAN’S PROPILOT SYSTEM THAN TESLA’S AUTOPILOT\n",
    "Keeping with a theme of less is more, there’s also no camera-based monitoring system in the truck to make sure the driver pays attention while using the Level 2 features. Instead, the Cascadia uses a system similar to the one found in Tesla’s cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sensor in the steering column measures resistance applied to the steering wheel. If the driver takes their hands off the wheel while using the lane centering feature, the instrument cluster will, after about 15 seconds, surface a warning that tells them to place their hands back on the wheel. If the driver doesn’t do that, the warning changes from yellow to red. After another 60 seconds, if the driver still hasn’t put their hands back on the wheel, the truck will come to a stop on the side of the road.\n",
    " \n",
    "The new Cascadia is a far cry from a fully autonomous truck, but based on my brief ride, Daimler has refined the technology compared to the prototype version. The prototype swayed on the highway during my two-mile demo ride in 2015, ping-ponging between the lane markers. The new truck, meanwhile, felt locked to the center of the lane during this week’s ride, which followed the same exact route from a few years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Daimler representative also told me that, while lane centering is on, the driver can even choose where the system places them in the lane. (For example, if a driver is on a tight one-lane highway and wants to avoid clipping oncoming traffic, they could tell the truck to hug the right lane line.) This is another sign that system is maturing from what debuted in 2015, though it’s a small one.\n",

    "Here’s the best timeline yet for the Milky Way’s big events\n",
    "Our galaxy formed its original disk 2 billion years before its stellar halo\n",
    "\n",
    "By Ken Croswell\n",
    "\n",
    "MARCH 23, 2022 AT 12:00 PM\n",
    "\n",
    "A new analysis of nearly a quarter million stars puts firm ages on the most momentous pages from our galaxy’s life story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Far grander than most of its neighbors, the Milky Way arose long ago, as lesser galaxies smashed together. Its thick disk — a pancake-shaped population of old stars — originated remarkably soon after the Big Bang and well before most of the stellar halo that envelops the galaxy’s disk, astronomers report March 23 in Nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are now able to provide a very clear timeline of what happened in the earliest time of our Milky Way,” says astronomer Maosheng Xiang.\n",
    "\n",
    "He and Hans-Walter Rix, both at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, studied almost 250,000 subgiants — stars that are growing larger and cooler after using up the hydrogen fuel at their centers. The temperatures and luminosities of these stars reveal their ages, letting the researchers track how different epochs in galactic history spawned stars with different chemical compositions and orbits around the Milky Way’s center.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There’s just an incredible amount of information here,” says Rosemary Wyse, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the study. “We really want to understand how our galaxy came to be the way it is,” she says. “When were the chemical elements of which we are made created?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Xiang and Rix discovered that the Milky Way’s thick disk got its start about 13 billion years ago. That’s just 800 million years after the universe’s birth. The thick disk, which measures 6,000 light-years from top to bottom in the sun’s vicinity, kept forming stars for a long time, until about 8 billion years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this period, the thick disk’s iron content shot up 30-fold as exploding stars enriched its star-forming gas, the team found. At the dawn of the thick disk era, a newborn star had only a tenth as much iron, relative to hydrogen, as the sun; by the end, 5 billion years later, a thick disk star was three times richer in iron than the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xiang and Rix also found a tight relation between a thick disk star’s age and iron content. This means gas was thoroughly mixed throughout the thick disk: As time went on, newborn stars inherited steadily higher amounts of iron, no matter whether the stars formed close to or far from the galactic center.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that’s not all that was happening. As other researchers reported in 2018, another galaxy once hit our own, giving the Milky Way most of the stars in its halo, which engulfs the disk (SN: 11/1/18). Halo stars have little iron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new work revises the date of this great galactic encounter: “We found that the merger happened 11 billion years ago,” Xiang says, a billion years earlier than thought. As the intruder’s gas crashed into the Milky Way’s gas, it triggered the creation of so many new stars that our galaxy’s star formation rate reached a record high 11 billion years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "The merger also splashed some thick disk stars up into the halo, which Xiang and Rix identified from the stars’ higher iron abundances. These “splash” stars, the researchers found, are at least 11 billion years old, confirming the date of the merger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thick disk ran out of gas 8 billion years ago and stopped making stars. Fresh gas around the Milky Way then settled into a thinner disk, which has given birth to stars ever since — including the 4.6-billion-year-old sun and most of its stellar neighbors. The thin disk is about 2,000 light-years thick in our part of the galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The Milky Way has been quite quiet for the last 8 billion years,” Xiang says, experiencing no further encounters with big galaxies. That makes it different from most of its peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the thick disk really existed 13 billion years ago, Xiang says, then the new James Webb Space Telescope (SN: 1/24/22) may discern similar disks in galaxies 13 billion light-years from Earth — portraits of the Milky Way as a young galaxy.\n",

    "The universe’s background starlight is twice as bright as expected\n",
    "It took a spacecraft at the solar system’s edge to make precise enough observations of dark sky\n",
    "\n",
    "By Liz Kruesi\n",
    "\n",
    "MARCH 22, 2022 AT 7:00 AM\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when you remove the bright stars, the glowing dust and other nearby points of light from the inky, dark sky, a background glow remains. That glow comes from the cosmic sea of distant galaxies, the first stars that burned, faraway coalescing gas — and, it seems, something else in the mix that’s evading researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers estimated the amount of visible light pervading the cosmos by training the New Horizons spacecraft, which flew past Pluto in 2015, on a spot on the sky mostly devoid of nearby stars and galaxies (SN: 12/15/15). That estimate should match measurements of the total amount of light coming from galaxies across the history of the universe. But it doesn’t, researchers report in the March 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It turns out that the galaxies that we know about can account for about half of the level we see,” says Tod Lauer, an astronomer at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab in Tucson, Ariz.\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, astronomers have measured the extragalactic background light in different wavelengths, from radio waves to gamma rays (SN: 8/23/13; SN: 11/29/18). This provides a census of the universe and gives researchers hints into the processes that emit those types of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the background visible light — dubbed the cosmic optical background, or COB — is challenging to measure from the inner solar system. Here, lots of interplanetary dust scatters sunlight, washing out the much fainter COB. The Pluto-visiting New Horizons spacecraft, however, is far enough from the sun that scattered sunlight doesn’t flood the spacecraft’s images.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in September 2021, Lauer and colleagues pointed the spacecraft’s LORRI camera toward a patch of sky and took a bunch of pictures. They digitally removed all known sources of light — individual stars, nearby galaxies, even heat from the spacecraft’s nuclear power source (SN: 2/18/16) — and measured what was left to estimate the COB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then they used large archives of galaxy observations, like those from the Hubble Space Telescope, to calculate the light emitted by all the galaxies in the universe. The measured COB is roughly twice as bright as that calculation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While Lauer’s group previously noted a discrepancy, this new measurement reveals a wider difference, and with smaller uncertainty. “There’s clearly an anomaly. Now we need to try to understand it and explain it,” says coauthor Marc Postman, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several astronomical reasons that could explain the discrepancy. Perhaps, says Postman, rogue stars stripped from galaxies linger in intergalactic space. Or maybe, he says, there is “a very faint population of very compact galaxies that are just below the detection limits of Hubble.” If it’s the latter case, astronomers should know in the next couple years because NASA’s recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will see these even-fainter galaxies (SN: 10/6/21).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility is the researchers missed something in their analysis. “I’m glad it got done; it’s absolutely a necessary measurement,” says astrophysicist Michael Zemcov of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York who was not involved in this study. Perhaps they’re missing some additional glow from the New Horizons spacecraft and its LORRI instrument, or they didn’t factor in some additional foreground light. “I think there’s a conversation there about details.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The light that reflects off the Milky Way’s dust, for example, is “a very subtle beast,” Zemcov says, “and our uncertainties likely get dominated by it at some point, just because it’s not very well understood.”  Several projects in the next few years, such as the CIBER-2 experiment and the space mission SPHEREx, could help astronomers understand this pesky dust-scattered light,  Zemcov says.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, he and his research group member, astrophysicist Teresa Symons, are poring through hundreds of old LORRI images of dark sky and running their own analyses. Meanwhile, Lauer and his colleagues will take more pictures of other patches of sky with LORRI to strengthen their confidence in the measurement of the background light and to better understand intrusions from the spacecraft itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There is something going on that we weren’t expecting,” Zemcov says, “which is where the fun part of science kicks in.”\n",

    "Among the performances is the \"Encanto\" cast performing “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” from the Disney film.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Film Twitter is ready to consign Oscars 22 to the dustbin of failed Oscar shows, the creative team behind the March 27th Oscar telecast are promising a show that’s anything but ordinary. From sets that extend into the audience to a production mandate that’s all about keeping the kinetic energy flowing seamlessly through ever-changing stagecraft, producers Will Packer and Shayla Cowan took a Thursday press conference to set the stage for an event that’s leaning on populist appeal while attempting not to further piss off riled-up cinephiles. “We are going to keep surprising you,” said Packer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controversially, eight categories will be presented before the live broadcast and edited into the live show, a move that’s meant to help keep things moving by forgoing tracking shots of winners making the long walk from their seats to the stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "“One of the misperceptions is that things are being taken off the show, that’s not the case,” Packer said. “Make no mistake, without a doubt, we’re going to make sure everybody has their moment. Because at the end of the day, it’s an entertaining show, we want to be celebratory and fun, but it is about celebrating the most talented people in the world and what they do.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Music will be a big part of the night. So important, in fact, that press conference moderator Mike Muse enthusiastically offered this in his introductory remarks: “I love that tagline of ‘music lovers unite,'” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is, in fact, “movie lovers unite,” reminded Packer, who is relying heavily on unique musical moments, including performances by Reba McEntire, Billie Eilish, and Beyoncé, to draw viewers to the show. Heading that effort is music director Adam Blackstone, an A-list MD who just wowed audiences at one of the most-watched televised events of the year: The 2022 Super Bowl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packer gave Blackstone a mandate: “You’ve got to top that,” he said. He’s got his work cut out for him, after a halftime show that featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem and Mary J. Blige. For the Oscars, Blackstone has crafted a segment he’s calling the “all-star band,” featuring him, Grammy winner Robert Glasper, Travis Barker, Sheila E., and “some other surprise guests.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I come from the pop music world, hip-hop, pop, country, all of that, and I come from the stage,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blackstone will also serve as one of the conductors of the orchestra, which will incorporate funk, hip-hop, and pop elements in addition to the expected classical flavors. And among the performances is the “Encanto” cast performing “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” from the Disney film.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packer, best known for mainstream films like “Girls Trip,” said his mandate was breaking the Oscars free from its stuffy, self-congratulatory reputation. “We didn’t want this show to just be for a specific audience. Sometimes this show has felt like ‘It’s just us, just Hollywood is invited, we don’t need you, you can come if you want to,'” Packer said. “This year we wanted to be a little bit more open in our embrace of the public.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Production designer David Korins (Tony nominated for “Hamilton”) wants that embrace to be palpable. He called the set “a big, huge dynamic sculpture” that looks to the future. “The very first conversation we had, Will and Shayla said, ‘We want to have fun, we want this to move seamlessly from one act to the next,'” Korins said. “We wanted to put forth a community-first design, something that feels fun and electric and exciting. We are decking over large parts of the audience. We are showing a picture of the future that feels super exciting. Every single piece of scenery has a light inside, it glows from inside, because our vision of the future is light-emitting and hopeful.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a beautiful image, but that puts potentially unvaccinated presenters within spitting distance of the audience, a reminder of the Academy’s two-tiered COVID-19 rules. Everyone in the audience must be vaccinated and tested (twice), but presenters and performers can opt for multiple tests instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other bits of entertainment will come from an embrace of films that are not nominated. There will be segments celebrating the 50th anniversary of “The Godfather,” the 60th birthday of Bond, and nods to some of the most popular movies of the last year. That will of course include the divisive decision to recognize the winners of Twitter popular movie polls, which was Packer and Cowan’s idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team said surprises will be plentiful. No, you shouldn’t assume that the presenter of Best Picture has already been revealed in the roster that includes Tony Hawk as well as other more traditional Hollywood figures. But one thing will be done the old way: in a revert from last year’s procedure, Best Picture will be handed out last.\n",
