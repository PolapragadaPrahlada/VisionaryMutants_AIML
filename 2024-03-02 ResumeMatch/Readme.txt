* The file 'ResumeMatch_20240302.ipynb' is a one stop solution for the AIML model development process for predicting a resume match.

* This file is devided into the following four files:
  'ResumeMatch_20240302_01_Data.ipynb',
  'ResumeMatch_20240302_02_Model.ipynb',
  'ResumeMatch_20240302_03_WebApp.ipynb',
  'ResumeMatch_20240302_04_GuiApp.ipynb'
  This devision is to practice the real word development method.

* Actually, the base for the file 'ResumeMatch_20240302.ipynb' is 'WF_Project#01.ipynb' of 'D:\DataBackup\Work\2021-11-15 Kalyana@Wells Fargo\2022-02-09 Project#01 RunbookTool'.

* Actually to develop 'Runbook Tool' for Wells Fargo, studied several things and prepared the basic solution with generic data and finally the result is the file 'WF_Project#01.ipynb'. This file was sent to Wells Fargo to develop 'Runbook Tool' with Wells Fargo data.

* Then modified and updated the file 'WF_Project#01.ipynb' and finally implemented the solution for 'Runbook Tool' for Wells Fargo as the file 'Runbook_20220826.ipynb'.

* Using the file 'Runbook_20220826.ipynb', developed another solution for Balaram's team as the file 'ReportFrequency.ipynb'.  This file is devided into 3 for realtime deployment.

* At the time of Wells Fargo hackathon in 2024, using the file 'Runbook_20220826.ipynb' and using the generic data implemented the hackathon solution 'ResumeMatch_20240302.ipynb'.

* Finally, by taking the file 'ResumeMatch_20240302.ipynb' of Wells Fargo as reference, created this 'ResumeMatch_20240302.ipynb' with the same name.  Improved it by changing variable names, adding additional code, implementing the concept of sending function name as parametr etc. made this file a best solution to the AIML NLP related problems.
